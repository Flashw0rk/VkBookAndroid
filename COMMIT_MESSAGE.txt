feat: preserve Excel formatting when editing armature database

Problem:
When editing the armature database in the editor, all Excel formatting 
(column widths, cell styles, colors, borders, fonts) was lost. The edited 
files became unreadable and poorly formatted compared to the original.

Solution:
Modified ArmaturesExcelWriter to preserve Excel formatting during save operations:
- Save original column widths before modifications
- Extract and copy header cell styles for new cells
- Preserve existing cell formatting when updating values
- Restore column widths after data modifications
- Apply consistent styling to newly created rows

Technical Changes:
- app/src/main/java/com/example/vkbookandroid/editor/ArmaturesExcelWriter.kt
  * Added originalColumnWidths map to preserve column dimensions (lines 27-31)
  * Added headerCellStyles extraction from header row (lines 71-74)
  * Modified cell creation logic to clone styles from headers (lines 89-117)
  * Added column width restoration before file write (lines 121-126)

Testing:
- Verified with existing Armatures.xlsx files
- Tested formatting preservation in both originals/ and editor_out/ directories
- Confirmed no data loss or corruption
- Validated backward compatibility with existing workflows

Impact:
✅ Excel files maintain professional appearance after editing
✅ Column widths preserved exactly as in original
✅ Cell formatting (colors, fonts, borders, alignment) preserved
✅ No breaking changes to existing code
✅ Interface IArmaturesExcelWriter remains unchanged
✅ Full backward compatibility

Build Info:
- Release APK: 13.49 MB (optimized by R8 compiler)
- No additional dependencies required
- Compatible with Android API 26+
